By default Spring Security dependency creats - "Basic Http Authentication". 
css directory, js directory, images directory are not scrutinized by Security. These directories are ignored by Spring Security.

Spring Security dependency creates a default Bean - AuthenticationManager that uses in-memory store that has a single user
user - "user"
password - from logs

user and password can be customized using application.properties file

ApplicationEventPusblisher - publishes security events that can be received by an application listener - CustomSecurityEventListener.java

Programmatically Spring auto security features can be overwritten with @EnableWebSecurity and extending the class WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter  
Note : Nothing much has been implemented in - protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception
Teacher suggested to refer to Spring Security documentation to add application specific logic

NOTE : I downgraded Spring to 1.3.3.RELEASE from 2.0.0.RELEASE as OAUth sample provided by teacher did not work.
New OAuth2 in 2.0.0.RELEASE is different and different annotations should be used for that.
